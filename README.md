## Project Overview

This project is designed to provide 3D visualization and interactivity for:

- Data connections
- Links between nodes
- Web systems
- Networks

By enabling you to visualize and interact with your data in a 3D space, this tool makes it easier to grasp complex structures and gain a deeper understanding of the relationships within your data. This approach is particularly beneficial for exploring larger, more intricate systems.

## Example Use Case

One example of how this repository can be used (and is used in this project) is to visualize a "network of people," where you can see your network and the relationships between individuals. However, the application is highly versatile and can be adapted to other scenarios, such as visualizing the network of Database tables and their connections.

## Open Source Contribution

This project is open-source and available for use in your projects free of charge. Contributions are welcome, and I appreciate any enhancements or improvements from those with expertise in the field.
